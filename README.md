ViewMachine-Server
==================

Node.JS Module for creating, reading and writing ViewMachine content on the server side.

This module will be added to NPM eventually, but for now, to include this module, add the follwing line to your node application:

`var VM = require('./viewmachine-server')`

#Note: lower case vm is the nodeJS Virtual Machine built-in-module, either use VM, or the longer form ViewMachine to avoid conflict and confusion.
